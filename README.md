How AI has helped skip the uncanny valluer and fool humans into thinking things are real


Talk Given at the Humanics in Media and Technology:

There is a continuum: Humans are taking Turing tests to prove to robots that we are human, but what we perceive as real is mediated by “robots.” By virtualizing our experiences, we’ve begun to use machine learning to mediate our access to knowledge and our senses. Virtual learning is a quick and iterable learning loop, but when we involve the real world, things slow down to a real-life pace. Now that machine learning models can be embedded in microcontrollers, and mobile devices can now act as senses and actuators. This advance allows machine learning techniques to enable increased accessibility and inclusivity. In this talk, we’ll walk through the details with examples from Minecraft to DIY robot projects.




- [] Robots want to know we're real in order to provide us services.
 * When we're real we get to...
 * If a robot or automated process passes the test it get's ...  to as well. 
 
- [] Rapid lerning and experience

- [] Virtualize our knowledge via the desing sprint process.
 * Image of Idea - Learn - Build - Launch loop
 * [Idea -> Image]. then build, launch, repeat

- [] Minecraft Learning loop. Teaching yourself microntrollers virtual. 
 * Building in real life the same thing takes long and require debuging and testing.

- [] Mediating our sense and experiences via machines
  * More inclusion: Microcnotllers smoothing out the real world to bring virtual knowledge to reality.
  * Robot hands...

- [] What do we think is real now?
 * THings we see, hear, touch, taste, or smell online?

- [] experiments in the amkerspace: DIY Autonmous Cars

- [] Acessibility: Who can use this tech?
 * Does the tech need to be mediate?
 * Are these things we should really be doing?
 
- [] Inclusion:
 * Facial Recognition
 * Emotion and sentitment
 * What can we use?
 * SHould this be democratized?
 
 - [] Conclusion: 
  * We've worked hard to learn, interact, and engage the world. It's been found to be flat. Our experuience in these cocvid19 times has pushed us to virtual more interactions.  If I can have comptuer read for me and find the important stuff, if I can delegate it to play games, and achieve the objectives I request, why should I wait around for my one agenda item in Zoom when I can virtually be there.
